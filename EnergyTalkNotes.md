### Importance of PM & Delivering On TIme
- First speaker (Panel host asking questions): 
	- Director of external relationships & something
	- Moderated by Jennifer Alsop
- Talk is about major nuclear projects that were on time and on budget
	- Setting a new model for success internationally
- Major infrastructure project
	- OPG Darlington Proj
	- Province has approved plans for refurbishment of Pickering unit B
	- Pickering is planning to refurbish 6 of it's 8 units
- Why is this significant?
	- We have a growing energy demand.
	- Electricity demand in Ontario is anticipated to grow 75% by 2050.

### First Panelist - Perrik Le Dreff, VP of Major Projects at Ontario Power Generation
- OPG
- Worked 10 years in Nuclear Engineering.
- Gradually started working on PM work without knowing it was PM work.
- Spent 10 years in Darlington refurbishment work in various roles, eventually become a director.
	- Most recently moved into VP role overlooking all sorts of nuclear waste type projects.
- 
### Second Panelist - Tasfia Preeti, P.Eng, PMP, Deputy Project Director at Aecon Group Inc. 
- Deputy project director at Aecon at Darlington
- Was good at STEM and health sciences but never thought she'd be in Engineering
- Spent 5 years doing engineering and management
- Internship with CNSC Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission?
- Was drawn to nuclear work.
- Did three years of engineering design work.
	- Realized engineers were not the bosses of the world.
	- Did what PM's told them to do.
- Joined Aecon fairly young as project coordinator
	- Started in mechanical refurbishments
		- Was able to move up and take on various PM related scopes
			- More civil work
			- Electrical
			- etc.
	- Moved onto working on feeder program for reactor
		- Became deputy directory for overall refurbishment at Aecon after this
- Her advice is to not let any opportunities get away from you
	- Being a project manager requires a lot of softer skills
		- This includes other programs outside of Engineering
- 
### Third Panelist - Aiman Khan, MBA, Senior Manager at Bruce Power
- Started at Ontario Tech in Automotive
	- When automotive was going through a downturn.
		- Lot of jobs left Ontario and went to China/Mexico etc.
		- She wanted to stay in Canada so she pivoted
- Worked on Mechatronics
	- Walked into assembly line at GM and was excited
	- Decided she would shift to robotics because she was enamored by it
	- Worked on ACE facilities
- When she graduated she found a job with Bruce Power for refurbishment work
	- Need to do further refurbishments on ageing reactors
	- Need to reduce radiation dosage which are affecting people
	- One solution was to deploy robots to remove human interaction with radioactive material
	- Next project was moving spacers from vibrations in a Ractor
	- Required a lot of technical knowledge and robots to deploy something that was first of it's kind in the industry.
- She got a lot of suggestions that she should switch to PM
	- Wanted to be a technical person, remaining in Engineering because she loved robotics
		- Decided to turn down the PM idea at this stage
	- Was working on a project to refurbish 6 of 8 reactors
		- Had a unique skillset since she had robotics experience but also nuclear design knowledge
		- Worked her way up to become an owners engineer that encompassed a wide range of work in the field
		- She was tasked to put together a team to fix an issue that came up
			- Came up with a solution within two months which involved various companies supporting Bruce Power at that time
		- Was told she has to come to project
			- They needed someone with technical depth 
			- Started to bring highly technical folks into PM to make certain decisions
			- Was brought back in as a Senior PM to oversee work
		- Current department is innovation and tooling
			- First of a kind tooling that installs tubes using robots
			- Data analytics, AI, and tech innovation
		- Key takeaway
			- Always go after opportunities that seem really hard to get
				- You'll figure it out when you get there.


### Can you define trends shaping the direction of projects? What are we doing different?
- Was able to lean heavily on existing teams to get work done.
- Nuclear industry is a global community, but when you look deeper it's not that big.
	- Important to be collaborative
	- Get to meet people from all over the world and how they approach things
- You cannot rush into execution. 
	- Must take the time to plan and prepare.
	- Took half a decade to get ready and billions of dollars just to get a mockup going.
	- Founding principal of invest in planning and invest in people.
- Hiroshima and Fukushima caused a lot of people to stray away from the nuclear industry
	- Since there wasn't a lot of work done for decades, it's hard to start it up again because of the lost experience, knowledge, etc.
	- With Canada, it never stopped needing nuclear so it stuck with it over the years.
- Right now the industry is booming
	- Lot of efforts into making sure we're on the path of clean energy
	- Lessons learned from all who are experienced in the industry was a big part of the overall success for Tasia.
	- Did not have the privilege to do a lot of the upfront planning but was able to learn from those more experienced who reached out to OPG Darlington Facility.
- There's a lot of information sharing to learn how to do things better.
- World is going through a huge electrification process right now.
- AI has shook the industry as a whole.
	- The amount of power needed for datacenters needed to power AI is enormous.
- Major climate changes are impacting things like energy needs.
	- Eg. not enough solar or wind in an area that relies on it during certain periods could lead to loss of power.
	- At this point Nuclear is the cleanest energy you can how, which is why more countries are getting onboard.
		- Canada is leading the projects and making bold moves
		- Takes a massive workforce to put it together
	- Need to look ahead and innovate.

### What are some of the interesting challenges and successes the panelists have had.
- Some of the robots work that has been done required some extremely complex coding to perform complex tasks at a reactor.
	- Install reactor components
	- Cameras doing fire watches
- Moving towards AI.
	- Optimizing things like ChatGPT type work
	- Checking documentation and saving Engineers time so they can focus on other, more important work
- This type of industry, when it grows momentum, innovates very quickly
- Having a vision is very important.
	- Whether its a small or large project, 
		- Understanding the end goal and having vision of he end state is very important
		- Having a vision and common goal was a common theme for successful project outcomes
	- Rally your team around this vision.
		- Can have the most innovative idea,
			- but it is important to communicate this well to the right stakeholders
	- One team mindset is very important in focusing on a collective goal
		- There is no us vs them, even when it coms to working with other companies: Bruce Power, OPG, etc.
		- We are one team
	- PM must be able to collaborate well and communicate with all necessary stakeholders.
		- Must keep things moving forward.
	- Ensuring team working for you is not de-motivated.
		- Must be calm and level headed
	- Having a good plan for course-correction when things go awry
- If team can be motivated to do the PM work, that's a win.
- The biggest win is when all stakeholders walk away happy.
- There will aways be challenges & risk management is crucial.
	- Eg. because of a human performance issue, there was damage to tooling, which extended project timeline.
		- Need to re-assess project plan to work through problems and adapt to challenges that come up.
		- Requires close coordination and vision to overcome these challenges
		- Must take all the right actions and do upfront planning to mitigate or prepare for risks before it happens.
- How you manage challenges is very important.
	- eg. Refurbishment involves taking things apart in the first phase, and putting it back together.
	- If you don't track what you did taking it apart, you won't know how to put it back together.
	- Inspection team pulled out a piece that shouldn't have been disconnected.
	- Basically had to have a mega pivot to create a brand new team, order new materials, establish new partners, build mockup facilities out in Cambridge.
		- Was a microcosm of the subset of the larger problem which was Darlington refurbishment 
		- Had to be dealt with before getting back on track.
		- Was an unforeseen challenge that they had to figure out if they could accomplish with limited resources
			- Only had a number of skilled & experienced workers required for this technical work
		- Half a billion dollars of work that appeared overnight.
	- Respond to challenges and don't stick to your opinions too tightly. Be flexible.

### What is the most important for project managment? 
- Communication and leadership, problem-solving and adaptabilit, time and budget management, technical experties, etc?
- Already covered in the previous sections.

### How many years of engineering experience would you recommend before going into project coordination/mgmt?
- Parad was focused on being a competent engineer.
	- The more he allowed himself to broaden his interests, more opportunities popped up.
	- At least have something where you can stand behind our achievements
	- You've invested enough time and energy int the field to confidently say that you have some core competencies.

### Would you say that Mechatronics engineers would have a place in nuclear projects for the future as well?
- Answered by Iman.
- Nuclear sector is moving towards robotics in a lot of cases.
	- This is not going away.
	- Further investments are being made into this.
	- Will be a much needed skillset in the nuclear section.
### What was the biggest learning curve you experienced during your career...
- Answered by tasia.
- Her answer was culture. 
	- She started out very reserved and didn't' talk to people all that much in the initial work she did.
	- Was used to being on time for submissions without delays or setbacks that come at play when doing project coordination work which she had to adapt to.
		- Eg. delays because radiation protection was not available
	- Had to listen to everyone's input and feedback and be very diplomatic in ensuring everyone's opinions were heard and all appropriate stakeholders were consulted

### At what point would you move on in a project to avoid getting stuck in "analysis paralysis"? 
- Answered by Iman.
- Important to get the requirements right.
	- Must get the analysis right, but also refine it to get things right.
		- Lot of stakeholders to consider when making this decision.
		- You might be the face of the decision and may need technical depth to make the decision, but an entire team needs to make decisions.
			- These decisions need to be communicated well and carefully selected when making presentations.
