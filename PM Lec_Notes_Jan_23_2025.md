### Liability for Ignoring Safety Requirements
- Government will shut project down
- They will freeze the site
- Becomes potential for criminal investigation
- As project manager you have to demonstrate due diligence under the law
	- Meaning, did you provide reasonable care?
	- Eg. John got killed on worksite, tragic accident
		- Did you exercise due diligence when exercising safety?
			- Training people for safety
			- Checking if people follow what they were trained in
	- If company is the problem, fine of up to $2,000,000 for a corporation
	- $1,500,000 for directors and officers of corporations
		- Plus up to 12 months of imprisonment
	- A fine of up to $500,000 for all other persons
		- Plus up to 12 months of imprisonment
- A successful project is a safe project!
- Safety is not a burden, it's an asset.
	- Let's you pay attention to quality, cost, etc.
- Watch your actions and words as a leader.
	- Eg. If you talk about safety once but never bring it up a gain, you talk a good line but you don't care about it.
### Stewardship in the context of PM
- Act responsibly.
- Standard your held to is not perfection.
	- Eg. you don't have to remind people every single day.
	- It's more, do you have a program in place to practice safety each day?
- **Integrity**
	- Doing the right thing when no one is watching you.
	- Guided by our moral conscience to do the right thing in line with your responsible to all stakeholders.
- **Trustworthiness**: 
	- Staying true to your word.
	- Honesty.
	- Be predictable.
- **Compliance**
	- We have rules to comply with.
		- Some are legal.
		- Some are internal.
			- Company expects you to do business a certain way.
		- Comply until you can convince them to change the requirement.
	- We have a broad commitment to stewards of society and environment.
### Project Planning Aspects
- Scope management plan
	- We have to manage many things including
		- Scope
			- What are you going to do?
			- We agreed on what we're going to do and we can't change it once it's set in stone without due process.
			- Produce a schedule and mange to that schedule.
			- 
- Requirements management plan
- Schedule mangement plan
- Cost management plan
	- Once you have a schedule, figure out what it's going to cost.
				- If  you produce a cost estimate without know what to do, the estimate is science fiction.
				- Sweat the details on what client wants.
				- Figure out how to do the activities need and get activities done.
- Quality management plan
	- Just getting it done isn't enough.
	- Have to take safety into account
		- Quality
		- All requirements
- Communications management plan
- Risk management plan
	- When risk arises, what can we do to ensure all other criteria are met.
		- Maybe talk to the client that it's out of your control, but it might cost more.
			- Let's talk about how we're going to handle that.
	- Identify all the risks
		-  The important thing is to have it listed
			- If you're not aware, you can't plan for and mitigate the risk
- Procurement management plan
	- Where am I going to buy
	- Who am I going to buy from
	- What strategy would I use?
		- Most govts do what's called competitive bidding (go to one source to get something)
			- Often companies have a sole source for reliability and trust
			- Most big govt projects won't allow that
				- Suppliers can gain a monopoly
				- Most businesses want you to get two sources just incase one can't fulfill the requirement
				- Govt is worried about the public perception of favoritism
- Stakeholder management plan
	- Who's the stakeholder?
	- How am I going to mange my interface?
	- Who are the ones that are really important to your success?
- Scope vs Requirement mgmt plan
	- Scope doesn't tell you about exactly what your doing
		- Eg. Build a building
	- Requirements are what are required in terms of standards and expectations.
		- eg. What sort of building? 
			- What are the details?
			- General regulations?
			- Stakeholder requirements?
### Your Plan MUST
- What must be done?
	- What good looks like depends on exactly what the customer wants.
	- Obligated under stewardship to give you something that meets the minimum standard.
	- Must mange expectations well.
- How should it be done?
- Who will do it?
- By when must it be done?
- How much will it cost?
- how good does it have to be?

### Coping with Uncertainty
- Validate assumptions.
- If you are making assumptions, write down where it came from.
	- What are we going to do to validate?
	- Then ask stakeholder if that's what they want.
	- Keep records of validation.
- Cost estimates need to have a range on them.
	- Otherwise it's a guess.
**Gated Release Approach**
<img width="488" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57714cbe-9eef-4db9-a4b0-2d952316b21e" />

- For big projects that cost a lot of money, and you don't know all the details at the beginning.
	- Let's not take it all in one chunk.
	- Can't give credible estimate when we have so many unknowns.
	- Break it down into financial pieces.
	- Figure out what we want to build and where we want to build it.
	- Release a percentage of the cost to a limited scope, and try to plan a project milestone for it.
		- Figure out timeline
		- Cost
		- Flesh out uncertainties 
	- Whatever is spent is sunk cost. 
		- The decision is do I finish or not.
	- Flowchart above is called the go-kill milestone.
		- If the project goes over budget after going past the first couple of releases, must decide if we should spend the rest of the funds to get value from the proj or scrap the project.
		- Money for one piece. Then go-no-go decision. money for next piece. Then go-no-go decision. etc.
### Principles the same - details company specific
- Project gating plan should be tailored to the project it supports.
	- If there is big money, big risk, it should be gated to manage it in chunks.
	- It must reflect the project approach
	- It must incorporate input from departmental and external stakeholders.
	- Consider the project's risks and issues.
	- Account for project dependencies and constraints.
	- Denote any planned assurance activities and independent reviews.

### Agile vs Gating - Difference of Thinking
- Agile is to ship a prototype to customer quickly and iterate based on feedback.
- Gating requires you to get all project requirements covered from the beginning, because resources are finite. Once a process is put into motion, it can't be easily reversed like in software dev.


### Practical Example
- Our group said we'd have to do research and provide an estimate based on new technology etc. to figure out various budgets. Then we'd likely go with the gated release approach if that's ok for the project.
- Group two did a quick risk assessment and didn't outright said no, but said there might be some things we'd need to think about.
- Group 3 did a quick risk assessment and provided a qualified maybe.
- Group 4 provided an actual value of 20 to 24 Billion after turning down the 16 Billion. They took into account extra room that might be needed for extra expenditures. A variation of the prior approach, where a number is thrown out, but we need to talk a bit more.
- Group 5 would not approach the govt for the project because there is a possibility that all factors may not be considered. They are worried about a quality breach with the existing budget. We can't sign up for this deal. We don't know enough about it yet, but a little firmer in saying no. 
- Next group said no at this stage. There are too many uncertainties. It could be cheaper or more expensive so it's a no until more research is done.
	- Great hook here was that they mentioned the price could go down.
- Every group was right in their own way.
	- There is no right or wrong way
- Most companies would not accept the deal as is, because this could be a multi billion dollar problem.
- If you want the business, got to find a way to influence the client in a way that we can both get what we want.
- There are too many flawed assumptions with this project requirement. Just because it was done cheaper elsewhere, doesn't mean it'll cost that much here.
	- No substance to the initial assessment
	- Should be careful about the assumptions being made

### A way to think about the project 'Front End'
- Get problem clear, requirements clear, scope clear, initial plans clear (they will evolve)

Project Charter
- Document that sets the stage for the project.
- What's the purpose?
- What's the requirements?
- I asked prof if we need to commit to the budget in the charter phase.
	- We don't have to commit to a budget in the charter, especially if we're not certain about the requirements. 
	- If we are mentioning any budget, we better be certain about how we got there.

### Prof quickly went through part b of lecture slides. Here is the summary:
- The only thing a PM is an expert at is project management.
- PM's should be consulting and contracting experts for a specific role, but shouldn't be doing that work yourself.
- As a project manager you have to adapt to who has more authority in the project.
	- Eg. someone who is an expert in a chemistry project should probably have more say in a related project when making decisions.
	- All of this should be included in the stakeholder plan.
- Project is dead if you haven't managed the right stakeholder, and they have authority.
	- Varies company to company.
- Leadership is show me the goal or show me the way.
	- Long term goal
	- Vision
- Management is let's manage the work.
	- Structuring a plan
- Project managers need to find a good balance between the two, but the emphasis goes a bit more towards management.
- **Transformational** leadership style
	- Throw out the old way, because we have a new and improved way of doing things.
		- eg. using AI powered tools

### Blanchard's Model of leadership styles
<img width="263" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f40c4db7-2e24-4e1b-b128-777abc50f002" />

- Four categories of leadership styles
- **Directing**
	- I'm your leader and i'm telling you waht to do
	-  Typically when someone is very junior they are directed first.
		- They don't have the experience to know what to do yet. 
		- May not be ready to be coached.
	- Don't get most out of people by directing so it's not ideal for those with knowledge, but more so for those who have practically no experience.
- **Coaching**
	- I'm not going to tell you waht to do. I have knowlege. I'll let you do the task and I'll coach you.
	- eg. I can bring some experience and knowledge to help you improve your skills.
- **Supporting**
	- If you have a problem, tell me and I'll help you with the problem.
	- eg. I may not be experienced in your field, but if you need a certain $ amount to get work done, let me know and I'll get it for you.
- **Delegating**
	- People delegating to need to know what they're doing.
### Usually goes from
- Directing > Coaching > Supporting > Delegating
- You gotta know your people.
